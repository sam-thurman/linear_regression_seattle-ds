    "_Why_ does it happen that variables correlate? It _may_ be that one is the cause of the other. A city having a high population, for example, probably does have some causal effect on the number of buses that the city has. But this _need not_ be the case, and that is why statisticians are fond of saying that 'correlation is not causation'. An alternative possibility, for example, is that high values of X and Y are _both_ caused by high values of some third factor Z. The size of children's feet, for example, is correlated with their ability to spell, but this is of course NOT because either is a cause of the other. Rather, BOTH are caused by the natural maturing and development of children. As they get older, both their feet and their spelling abilities grow!\n",

    "## Statistical Learning Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important at this point to understand the distinction between dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly, the independent variable is what can be directly manipulated and the dependent variable is what cannot be (but is nevertheless of great interest). What matters structurally is simply that we understand the dependent variable to be a _function_ of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the proper interpretation of a statistical _model_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple idea: We can model correlation with a _line_. As one variable changes, so does the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model has two *parameters*: *slope* and *y-intercept*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless there's a perfectly (and suspiciously) linear relationship between our predictor(s) and our target, there will  be some sort of **error** or **loss** or **residual**. The best-fit line is constructed by minimizing the sum of the squares of these losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution for a simple regression best-fit line is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "- y-intercept:<br/> $\\Large b = \\mu_y - m\\mu_x$\n",

    "Note: The proof of this proceeds by setting the gradient of the loss function equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The relationship between target and predictor(s) is linear. (Of course!)\n",
    "2. The errors are mutually independent. (That is, there is no correlation between any two errors.)\n",
    "3. The errors are normally distributed. (That is, smaller errors are more probable than larger errors, according to the familiar bell curve.)\n",
    "4. The errors are homoskedastic. (That is, the errors have the same variance. The Greek word $\\sigma\\kappa\\epsilon\\delta\\acute{\\alpha}\\nu\\nu\\upsilon\\mu\\iota$ means \"to scatter\".)\n",

    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity describes the correlation between distinct predictors. Why might high multicollinearity be a problem for interpreting a linear regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's problematic for statistics in an inferential mode because, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are highly correlated with $y$ but also *with each other*, then it will be very difficult to tease apart the effects of $x_1$ on $y$ and the effects of $x_2$ on $y$. If I really want to have a good sense of the effect of $x_1$ on $y$, then I'd like to vary $x_1$ while keeping the other features constant. But if $x_1$ is highly correlated with $x_2$ then this will be a practically impossible exercise!\n",
